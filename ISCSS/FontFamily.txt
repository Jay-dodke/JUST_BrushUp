CSS Font Family

What it does
- The font-family property defines the typeface of text.
- You can list multiple fonts as a fallback stack.

Generic families
- serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, fantasy.

Best practice
- Always end your stack with a generic family.

Example
```
body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
```
