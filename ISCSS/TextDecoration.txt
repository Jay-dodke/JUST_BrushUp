CSS Text Decoration

What it does
- text-decoration adds decoration lines to text.
- The decoration can be controlled with line, color, style, and thickness.

Key properties
- text-decoration-line: underline, overline, line-through, or none.
- text-decoration-color: sets the line color.
- text-decoration-style: solid, double, dotted, dashed, wavy.
