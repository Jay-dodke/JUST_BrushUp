CSS Selectors

What they do
- CSS selectors are used to find (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
- CSS selectors can be grouped into five categories: simple, combinator, pseudo-class, pseudo-element, and attribute selectors.
- This page focuses on the most basic selectors.

Basic selectors covered
- element selector targets elements by tag name (e.g., p).
- id selector targets a single element by #id.
- class selector targets all elements with a class via .class.
- you can target only certain elements with a class (e.g., p.center).
- elements can have more than one class (e.g., class="center large").

Notes
- An id name cannot start with a number.
- A class name cannot start with a number.

Example
```
p { ... }
#para1 { ... }
.center { ... }
p.center { ... }
```
