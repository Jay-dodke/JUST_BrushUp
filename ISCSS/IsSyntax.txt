CSS Syntax

Basic structure
- A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
- The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
- The declaration block contains one or more declarations inside curly braces.
- Each declaration includes a property and a value separated by a colon.
- Declarations end with a semicolon.

Example
```
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}
```

Explanation
- `p` is the selector.
- `color` and `text-align` are properties.
- `red` and `center` are values.
