HTML Classes 

What it is
- The `class` attribute lets you give a name to an element.
- Many elements can share the same class, so they can be styled together.
- Classes are used by CSS and JavaScript to select elements.

Simple example
```
<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p class="city">London is the capital of England.</p>
```

Style a class with CSS
```
<style>
  .city {
    background-color: tomato;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
  }
</style>
```

Multiple classes
```
<h2 class="city main">Paris</h2>
```
- Separate class names with a space.

 tips
- You can use `class` on any HTML element.
- Class names are case sensitive.
- Use classes to keep your styles reusable and clean.
