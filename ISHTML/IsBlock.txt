HTML Block Elements

What it is
- Block-level elements start on a new line.
- They take the full width available by default.

Common block elements
- `<p>` (paragraph)
- `<div>` (division/section)

Basic example
```
<p>Hello World</p>
<div>Hello World</div>
```

Best practice
- Use block elements to structure page sections and layout.
