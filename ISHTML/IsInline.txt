HTML Inline Elements

What it is
- Inline elements do not start on a new line.
- They only take up as much width as necessary.

Common inline elements
- `<span>` (generic inline container)
- `<a>` (link)

Basic example
```
<p>This is <span>inline text</span> inside a paragraph.</p>
```

Best practice
- Use inline elements for small parts of text, links, or styling.
