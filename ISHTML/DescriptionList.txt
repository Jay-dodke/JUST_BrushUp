HTML Description Lists

What it is
- Description lists show terms with their descriptions.
- Use `<dl>` for the list, `<dt>` for the term, and `<dd>` for the description.

Basic example
```
<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
</dl>
```

Best practice
- Use description lists for term–definition style content.
- Keep each term close to its description.
