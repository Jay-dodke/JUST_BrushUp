Blockquote element (HTML)

What it is
- `<blockquote>` is used for long, block-level quotations.
- Browsers usually indent it to show the quoted passage is separate from your own text.

Basic example
```
<blockquote>
  This is an example of a blockquote element. It is used to show a long quotation.
</blockquote>
```

Best practice
- Use `<cite>` for the source when you have one.
- Don’t use `<blockquote>` just for indentation; use CSS for styling instead.

Example with source
```
<blockquote>
  “The important thing is not to stop questioning.”
  <cite>— Albert Einstein</cite>
</blockquote>
```
