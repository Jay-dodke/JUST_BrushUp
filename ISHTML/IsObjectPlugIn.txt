HTML Object and Plug-ins

What it is
- The `<object>` element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.
- It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash players).
- It can also embed HTML or images.

Basic example (embed HTML)
```
<object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>
```

Embed image
```
<object data="audi.jpeg"></object>
```

Fallback text
```
<object data="missing-file.pdf">
  Your browser does not support embedded objects.
</object>
```

Notes
- Most browsers no longer support Java applets and plug-ins, and Flash is disabled in modern browsers.
- Use `<iframe>` to embed HTML and `<img>` to embed images when possible.
