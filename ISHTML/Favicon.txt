HTML Favicon

What it is
- A favicon is the small icon shown in the browser tab.
- It is linked in the `<head>` using a `<link>` tag.

Basic example
```
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
```

Where to put it
- Inside the `<head>` section, after the `<title>` is common.

Notes
- The standard file name is `favicon.ico`, but other image types can work.
