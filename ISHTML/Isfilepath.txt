HTML File Paths

What it is
- A file path describes where a file is located.
- HTML uses file paths for images, links, scripts, and stylesheets.

Best examples (most common cases)

Same folder
```
<img src="picture.jpg" alt="My image">
```

Inside a folder
```
<img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="My image">
```

Parent folder
```
<img src="../picture.jpg" alt="My image">
```

Root folder (site root)
```
<img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="My image">
```

Absolute URL
```
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg" alt="W3Schools example">
```

Notes
- Use relative paths when linking to files in your own project.
- Use absolute URLs when linking to external resources.
- `../` means go up one folder level.
